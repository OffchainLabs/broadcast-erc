## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Broadcast Standard! All contributions are valued and appreciated. This guide outlines the steps and best practices for making external contributions.

### Introduction

By following these guidelines, you help maintain a consistent codebase and ensure that contributions align with our project’s goals and quality standards. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please open an [issue](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/broadcast-erc/issues) or contact one of the maintainers.

### Code Contributions

1. **License**: Ensure that your contributions follow the repo’s licensing rules, if any. Read the specific rules and requirements in the repo’s documentation and in the LICENSE file.

2. **Fork the Repo**: Begin by forking the repo. This creates your own copy of the repo where you can safely work on your changes.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes to keep your work isolated and organized. Use a descriptive branch name, such as "feature/your-feature-name"

4. **Follow Standards**: Make sure your code follows the project’s established coding standards and best practices.

5. **Write Tests**: Include comprehensive tests to ensure your changes function as expected. Follow the existing testing patterns and frameworks used in the repo and verify that all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: When your changes are ready, submit a pull request with a clear and detailed description of the modifications and the reasoning behind them. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and may require further discussion or revision.

7. **Contribution Agreement**: Submitting a pull request may require you to agree to a Contribution Agreement. This agreement ensures that all contributions comply with the repo’s licensing and legal requirements.

### Documentation Contributions

Contributions to documentation can be as valuable as code contributions! Ensure that any updates or additions to the documentation are clear, accurate, and consistent with the project’s style.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please report them by creating an issue in the repo’s [issue tracker](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/broadcast-erc/issues). Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue, screenshots, logs, and any relevant context.

### General Guidelines

- _Communication_: Open an [issue](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/broadcast-erc/issues) if you have any questions or need further clarification about the contribution process.
- _Commit Messages_: Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the rationale behind your changes. Imperative language is helpful (ex. "fix bug" or "add feature").
- _Code Reviews_: Engage constructively with reviewers during the code review process. Address feedback promptly to help ensure your changes are merged smoothly.
- _Documentation_: Update any relevant documentation or code comments to accurately reflect your changes.
